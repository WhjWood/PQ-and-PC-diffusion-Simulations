# PQ-and-PC-diffusion-Simulations
Source Code for simulations in Wood et al. 2018.

Contains all code used for simualtions in:

Wood, W.H., MacGregor-Chatwin, C., Barnett, S.F., Mayneord, G.E., Huang, X., Hobbs, J.K., Hunter, C.N. and Johnson, M.P., 2018. Dynamic thylakoid stacking regulates the balance between linear and cyclic photosynthetic electron transfer. Nature plants, 4(2), p.116.

details can be found in methods.

MC_3d_PQ is the main simulation program for PQ diffusion
MC_3d_PC is the main simulation program for PC diffusion

3d_PC_data_analysis and PC_bootstrap are analysis tools to account for the end membranes in thylakoids.
